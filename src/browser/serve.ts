// `globalThis`.
//
// UNIFIED dedicated-worker / Service-Worker wiring, no upfront detection flag: a
// dedicated worker's implicit channel (no port) and a Service Worker's per-client
// `MessagePort` are structurally distinguishable PER EVENT (`event.ports.length`),
// so ONE `message` listener handles both shapes uniformly — an event carrying a port
// spawns a per-port `MessagePortTransport` binding (multi-client); an event with no
// port but a string `data` routes through the implicit scope channel. Per AGENTS §3.3.4,
// this face imports project code freely (`@src/core` bundles into the worker) — the
// inlined-guards exception `node:worker_threads`' type-stripping forces on the Node
// face's `serve.ts` (`@orkestrel/worker`) does NOT apply here and is not copied.

/**
 * Boot an `MCPServer` inside a hostable scope (a dedicated Web Worker's `self`, or a
 * Service Worker's `self`) and wire its message events to it.
 *
 * @remarks
 * **Trust boundary — mechanism, not policy.** `serveMCPScope` exposes the ENTIRE
 * supplied `tools` registry to EVERY client the scope accepts a port from, with NO
 * built-in origin or identity check. In a Service Worker that means every same-origin
 * context the SW controls (any window, worker, or iframe can
 * `controller.postMessage(msg, [port])` and get a fully-bound server with complete
 * tool-call access). Origin allow-listing, handshake tokens, and any other gating are
 * the embedding application's responsibility — compose a guard in front. Use the
 * `accept` option to gate port-bearing events before binding: return `false` to drop
 * the event entirely (no binding, no reply).
 *
 * **Lifetime / per-client binding accumulation.** Each accepted port-bearing event
 * creates a fresh `MessagePortTransport` + `bindServer` binding that lives for the
 * scope's lifetime — there is NO per-client reaping, because `MessagePort` provides
 * no "peer closed" signal. For bounded, long-lived client sets this is fine; embedders
 * with high client churn must track and invoke the dispose function themselves to
 * avoid unbounded accumulation.
 *
 * **Portless events and the implicit scope channel.** A portless `message` event
 * (e.g. `controller.postMessage('<json-rpc>')` in a Service Worker) delivers its
 * string directly to the implicit scope transport — **the tool EXECUTES** — even
 * though no reply can reach the caller. In a `ServiceWorkerGlobalScope` the reply
 * path (`scopeTransport.send` → `scope.postMessage`) throws (no `self.postMessage`),
 * and `bindServer` routes the throw to the server emitter's `error` event (see
 * `@src/core bindServer`), so the un-repliable reply is dropped. The net effect is
 * **blind side-effecting ingress**: the tool runs but the caller gets no result.
 * Crucially, **`accept` does NOT gate this channel** — it is consulted only for
 * port-bearing events. In a Service Worker, if `accept` is your sole guard, ensure
 * all clients connect through transferred `MessagePort`s (port-bearing messages), or
 * restrict the exposed tools to side-effect-free operations, or validate a token
 * inside the tools themselves.
 *
 * Binds the implicit scope channel EAGERLY (at call time, not lazily on first use) —
 * `bindServer` is called once against a {@link import('./types.js').ScopeTransportInterface}
 * wrapping `scope` for the whole lifetime of the returned dispose, so a dedicated
 * worker's very first portless message is served with no first-use setup cost or
 * ordering hazard.
 *
 * Every inbound `message` event is inspected structurally: `event.ports.length > 0`
 * spawns a fresh {@link import('./factories.js').createMessagePortTransport} +
 * `bindServer` for THAT port (tracked for teardown) — this holds even on a
 * dedicated-worker-shaped scope, the unified design's deliberate cross-case. An
 * event with NO ports and a STRING `event.data` is delivered onto the implicit scope
 * channel; any other event (no ports, non-string data) is dropped.
 *
 * @param scope - The hostable scope to wire (structurally, `self` inside a worker)
 * @param options - `tools` (the live registry to expose; REQUIRED), optional
 *   `name`/`version` (default {@link import('./constants.js').DEFAULT_MCP_SERVER_NAME} /
 *   {@link import('./constants.js').DEFAULT_MCP_SERVER_VERSION}), optional `accept`
 *   (origin/identity gate for port-bearing events); see {@link ServeMCPOptions}
 * @returns A dispose function — unbinds every binding, closes every accepted
 *   `MessagePort`, and removes the scope's `message` listener. Idempotent.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const scope = { postMessage() {}, addEventListener() {}, removeEventListener() {} }
 * const dispose = serveMCPScope(scope, {
 *   tools: createToolManager(),
 *   // Prefer token-in-data — event.origin is empty for same-origin worker messages.
 *   accept: (event) => event.data === 'my-secret-token',
 * })
 * // ... later:
 * dispose()
 * ```
